20180118-dojo-jessie-fizzbuzz branch
====================================

This branch has the files created practicing 
[Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
with [Jessie](https://www.meetup.com/Central-Ohio-Python-Users-Group/members/242881395/)
at the [2018-01-18 dojo](https://www.meetup.com/Central-Ohio-Python-Users-Group/events/245120196/).
This time it is being done in an object-oriented way,
that is more familiar with Jessie
as opposed to using a simple function.

This is based on [tdd-demo](https://github.com/james-prior/tdd-demo).
